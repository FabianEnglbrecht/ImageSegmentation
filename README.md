# ImageSegmentation

The ImageSegmentation repository allows to analyze and visualize biological parameters from live cell imaging microscopy data 

Documentation is provided in the individual python scripts

Visualization results are shown in Fig.1 - Fig.5

Performance of automated and manual nuclei annotation: 
A: Number of automatically and manually annotated nuclei for a dataset of five images (I1-I5). 
B: Regions of interest provided by automatic and manual nuclei annotation. 
C: Annotation duration of a dataset containing 6409 fluorescently labelled nuclei with automatic (~5 minutes) and manual data annotation (~15 hours)


![nuclei tracking](https://github.com/FabianEnglbrecht/ImageSegmentation/blob/main/_Fig4_tracking.jpg)
Nuclei tracking results based on an automatically annotated dataset:
A: Tracks of fluorescently labelled nuclei. The color of the tracks indicates the speed of each individual nucleus/cell (from blue: Low speed, to red: High speed). 
B: Mean moving direction of nuclei within 8 hours 20 minutes. Predominant movement directions between 45˚-75˚ and 315˚-345˚ from its starting position.
